# Vehicle Troubleshooting Chatbot

## Overview

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that provides a conversational interface for vehicle troubleshooting and information. It leverages the Google Generative AI API and LangChain library to create a chatbot capable of answering questions related to vehicle parts and troubleshooting based on the content of PDF documents.

## Features

- **PDF Document Handling**: Index vehicle-related PDFs for reference.
- **Generative AI Integration**: Uses Google Generative AI for understanding and generating responses.
- **Vector Stores**: Stores and retrieves document embeddings using FAISS.
- **Question Answering**: Provides responses to user queries about vehicle troubleshooting.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Google Cloud API Key (for Google Generative AI)
- Required Python packages

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:

    Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your Google API key:

    ```plaintext
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
    ```

## Usage

### Running the App

1. **Start the Streamlit app**:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. **Interact with the App**:

    - **PDF Indexing**: Uncomment the relevant lines in the `main()` function to load and index PDF documents. Adjust the path to your PDF files as needed.
    - **Asking Questions**: Input your question into the text box to receive a response from the chatbot.

### Functions

- **`get_vector_stores(docs)`**: Generates and saves vector stores from the provided documents using Google Generative AI embeddings.
- **`get_conversational_chain()`**: Creates a conversational chain for answering questions based on vehicle-related context.
- **`get_response(user_question)`**: Retrieves an answer to the user's question using the conversational chain.

### Example Code Snippets

**Index PDFs and Get Responses**

Uncomment and customize the following lines in the `main()` function to enable PDF indexing:

```python
# loader = PyPDFDirectoryLoader("path/to/your/pdf/directory")
# documents = loader.load()
# text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
# final_documents = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
# get_vector_stores(final_documents)
# st.success("PDFs indexed successfully")
```

To ask questions:

```python
if user_question:
    response = get_response(user_question)
    st.write("Reply:", response)
```

## Notes

- Ensure you have the appropriate API key and access to Google Generative AI.
- Adjust paths and model names as necessary for your specific use case.
